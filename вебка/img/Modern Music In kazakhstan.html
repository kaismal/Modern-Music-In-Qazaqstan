        <p style="position: relative;left: 5%;width: 95% ; color: aliceblue">Modern Kazakh music is the traditions of past generations, which they managed to preserve, and they safely migrated to modern times. The younger generation skillfully uses the traditions of their ancestors and harmonizes heritage with modern styles. It turns out quite interesting compositions that are pleasant to listen to.<br>

We should also mention the musicians who not only perform songs, but also know how to play national instruments. They have a lot of listeners and every year the audience is only growing.<br><br>
Kazakh music is a synthesis of various styles. The new tracks immediately have fans who are eager to download the songs. If we compare Kazakh music with European, then it is much more melodic. That is why it is loved in many countries and is sung with pleasure.<br><br>

Kazakh songs are endowed with interesting originality and melody. But the singers are not going to stop there. Club music began to develop relatively recently. But not all regions are familiar with this direction. So far, Kazakh club music has received active development only in Almaty and Nur-Sultan.</p>

<p>The Rin'Go boy band consists of four members. Their names are Batyr, Aldan, Daniyar and Almaz.

The team was formed in the winter of 2006. The guys are all great at singing and moving. Why Rin'Go? Translated from Japanese, this word means "apple", since all Almaty guys, as you know, an apple is a symbol of the city, besides the name is very sonorous and laconic, we chose the word.</p>

    <p>Orda is a Kazakh music group. For the first time, the group appeared in the theater "Bauyrzhan Show" with the singing of brothers Bedelkhan and Orazbekov.
The name of the group was born on April 1, 2001. Prior to that, they were VIA, played episodic roles and appeared only in musical and dance performances of the theater. Since then, Yerbolat Bedelkhan has been responsible for the group's choreographic performances. Brothers Zhanbolat and Esbolat danced with him, and Dastan sang folk songs. And Rustem graduated from the acting studio opened in the theater.
The guys will perform for the first time on May 9 at a concert at the Palace of the Republic. At the same time the songs "Unknown Soul", "My Love" were released and recorded. Later, the brothers will be responsible for all musical and dance performances of the theater.

        <h6>CONCLUSIONS WITH OTHERS</h6>
        <p>Q-POP is a musical subculture that originated in Kazakhstan and absorbed elements of Western electropop, hip-hop, dance music and modern rhythm and blues. The founder of this genre of music is Ninety One, which debuted in 2015 and gave impetus to the direction of Q-pop. After her, many other groups and artists of this genre appeared in Kazakhstan in five years.</p>
        <p>But I want to say that this direction does not represent specific requirements such as dyed hair or earrings on the ears. Therefore, one can rightfully consider the same IK, Moldanazar, Darkhan Juz and many more similar groups and artists as part of Kew-pop, since its main requirement is the promotion and popularization of Kazakh content, that is, songs in Kazakh. And as it is noticed, such people write songs themselves, they themselves create their own creativity and music.</p>
